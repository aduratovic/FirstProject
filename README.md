TICKTACKTOW

TICKTACKTOW is a strategic game where two players take turns putting their marks(typically player 1 is X and player 2 is O) into a 9 square grid until one gets 3 of their marks in a row, column or diagonal. 5 total turns is the soonest that a winner could be determined. The round ends in a tie if neither player succeeds in getting 3 in row after 8 total moves
