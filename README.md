TICKTACKTOW

NETLIFY: https://tiktaktow1.netlify.app/

TICKTACKTOW is a strategic game where two players take turns putting their marks(typically player 1 is X and player 2 is O) into a 3x3 grid until one gets 3 of their marks in a row, column or diagonal. 5 total turns is the soonest that a winner could be determined. The round ends in a tie if the grid is filled and neither player has 3 in a row.
